# 2024-Robot
The code for Team Paradise's main robot during the 2024 CRESCENDO season, Rhino.

Features of the code include:
- Auto-align and auto-pickup note implementation
- Point drivetrain towards speaker
- Point arm towards speaker (not currently used as the arm is in a static position)
- CTRE Swerve Library project, which allowed us to quickly create the initial drivebase code
